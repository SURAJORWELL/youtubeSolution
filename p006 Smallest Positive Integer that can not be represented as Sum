Smallest Positive Integer that can not be represented as Sum
Given an array of size N, find the smallest positive integer value that cannot be represented as sum of some elements from the array.
Example 1:

Input: 
N = 6
array[] = {1, 10, 3, 11, 6, 15}
Output: 
2
Explanation:
2 is the smallest integer value that cannot 
be represented as sum of elements from the array.

long smallestpositive(long[] array, int n){ 
        Arrays.sort(array);
        //next is the next number
        long next=1;
        
        for(long i:array)
        {
            if(i<= next)
                next += i;
            
            else
                break;
        }
    return next;
    }
