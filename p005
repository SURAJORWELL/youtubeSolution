Nth Natural Number 

Given a positive integer N. You have to find Nth natural number after removing all the numbers containing digit 9 .


Example 1:

Input:
N = 8
Output:
8
Explanation:
After removing natural numbers which contains
digit 9, first 8 numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
and 8th number is 8.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 9
Output:
10
Explanation:
After removing natural numbers which contains
digit 9, first 9 numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10
and 9th number is 10.

// we did conversion of decimal to base 9

long findNth(long N)
    {
        long sum=0;
        long temp =1;
        
        while(N!=0)
        {
            sum += temp * (N % 9);
            temp *= 10;
            N /=9;
        }
//System.out.println(sum);
return sum;
    }
